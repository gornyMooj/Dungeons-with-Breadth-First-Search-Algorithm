# Dungeons with Breadth-First Search Algorithm


Breadth-first search (BFS) is an algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key'), and explores all of the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to the nodes at the next depth level. [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breadth-first_search)

The code creates a random dungeon with the random entrance and exits. It also finds the shortest path between the entrance and the exit.

The way from Start (S) to Exit(E) is represented with the letters L-left, R-right, U-up, D-down.
